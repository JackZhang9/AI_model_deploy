i upload a completely item,this is a time series data forecast,this belowe is my steps:
1.i choose the temp and windspeed data of the climate datasets,you can extract it from the datasets i promoted,
2.than i make a preprocessing for this datas,i choose a simple ml model to make model training and save it as a pkl format which is  a binary file,
3.i make a app file,i input model pkl file and use it to make a prediction,and give it a port 80,so you can open it with a web,
4.i make html file,and use it to display windows.
